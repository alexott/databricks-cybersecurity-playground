# Cybersecurity-related user-defined functions for Unity Catalog

There is a number of user-defined functions that could be useful when working with heterogeneous log sources.

Now available:

- `protocols.sql` contains two functions `proto_name_to_code` and `proto_code_to_name` to remap network protocol codes and names.
- `ocsf.sql` contains functions that map `activity_id` into `activity_name` for different categories.
